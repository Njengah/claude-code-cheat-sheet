## Overview

Subagents in Claude Code provide specialized expertise for different aspects of software development. Instead of using a general-purpose agent for all tasks, you can leverage these focused agents to get better results for specific use cases.

### Key Benefits

- **Specialized Knowledge**: Each agent has domain-specific expertise
- **Optimized Tools**: Agents have access to tools most relevant to their specialty
- **Better Context**: Focused agents maintain context relevant to their domain
- **Faster Results**: Specialized agents can work more efficiently in their area

## Quick Reference

### When to Use Each Subagent

| Task Type | Recommended Subagent | Example Use Case |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Building UI components | Frontend UI Expert | "Create a responsive navigation bar" |
| Code quality review | Production Validator | "Review this code for production readiness" |
| Writing documentation | Code Documentor | "Document this authentication module" |
| Complex research | General Purpose | "Find all API endpoints in this codebase" |
| Multi-step automation | General Purpose | "Set up CI/CD pipeline with testing" |

### Subagent Invocation Patterns

```bash
# Using Task tool to invoke subagents
/task description="Build user profile component" subagent_type="frontend-ui-expert"
/task description="Review code quality" subagent_type="production-validator"
/task description="Create API docs" subagent_type="code-documentor"
/task description="Research database schema" subagent_type="general-purpose"
```

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Subagent

1. **Match Task to Expertise**: Choose the subagent whose specialty aligns with your task
2. **Consider Tool Requirements**: Some subagents have limited tool access by design
3. **Think About Context**: Specialized agents maintain better focused context
4. **Use General Purpose for Complex Tasks**: When tasks span multiple domains, use the general-purpose agent

### Effective Subagent Usage

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed task descriptions
2. **Set Clear Expectations**: Specify what you want the subagent to deliver
3. **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information
4. **Chain Subagents**: Use multiple subagents in sequence for complex workflows

### Common Patterns

```bash
# Frontend Development Workflow
1. Frontend UI Expert: Build component
2. Production Validator: Review for production
3. Code Documentor: Create component documentation

# Code Review Workflow  
1. Production Validator: Initial quality check
2. General Purpose: Complex analysis if needed
3. Code Documentor: Update documentation

# Research and Implementation
1. General Purpose: Research and planning
2. Specialized Agent: Implementation
3. Production Validator: Final review
```

## Integration Workflows

### Multi-Agent Workflows

Claude Code allows you to chain subagents together for complex workflows:

1. **Sequential Processing**: Use agents one after another
2. **Parallel Processing**: Run multiple agents concurrently
3. **Conditional Logic**: Choose agents based on task requirements

### Example Workflows

#### Complete Feature Development
```
1. General Purpose: Research requirements and plan architecture
2. Frontend UI Expert: Build user interface components  
3. Production Validator: Review code quality and security
4. Code Documentor: Create comprehensive documentation
```

#### Code Quality Pipeline
```
1. Production Validator: Automated quality checks
2. General Purpose: Complex issue analysis (if needed)
3. Frontend UI Expert: UI-specific fixes (if applicable)
4. Code Documentor: Update documentation
```

## Getting Started

1. **Identify Your Task Type**: Determine which subagent is most appropriate
2. **Use the Task Tool**: Invoke the subagent using Claude Code's Task tool
3. **Provide Clear Instructions**: Be specific about what you want accomplished
4. **Review Results**: Each subagent will provide a focused response
5. **Chain as Needed**: Use multiple subagents for complex workflows

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Subagent Patterns

You can create sophisticated workflows by combining subagents with Claude Code's other features:

- **Session Management**: Maintain context across subagent invocations
- **Tool Permissions**: Configure specific tool access for security
- **Output Formatting**: Use structured output for automation
- **Error Handling**: Implement fallback patterns between subagents

### Performance Optimization

- Use specialized subagents to reduce context switching
- Leverage parallel subagent execution when possible
- Cache common subagent results for repeated tasks
- Monitor subagent performance with Claude Code's cost tracking
